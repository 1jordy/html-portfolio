    These are 3 of my Favorite Movies <br />
</h1>
<hr />
<h2>
    Dope
</h2>
<p>
    This movie was a great coming to age film about <br/>
    "a black kid from the hood"
</p> 
<h2>
    The Mask
</h2>
<p>
    It was one of the earliest films I watched from Jim Carey. <br />
    I liked him and Jennifer Aniston as the two main costars. <br />
    It was funny and sad and funny again.
</p>
<h2>
    Equalizer 2
</h2>
<p>
    Denzel and the Equalizer movies are top tier. <br />
    All of them are nice, but this just happened to be <br />
    the first one I've seen.
