<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This is my first portfolio of projects. I am a junior web developer looking to learn more
  about the world of UI/UX design.</p>

<p>My first two years of school I studied computer science where we dealt with the C++ language.
  I was introduced to an introduction of programming and coding. </p>

<p>I am currently an RBT after gaining my bachelors in Psychology. Hopefully, I would love to navigate to a 
  remote position as a web developer or UI/UX designer. This is something I have tried learning
  on my own, so it could potentially bring new and different opportunities.
